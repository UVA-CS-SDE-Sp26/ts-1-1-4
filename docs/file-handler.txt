The file handler takes an input from the command line which is then used to
select a file and read it line by line. This information can then be retrieved
by any branch using getData which returns the data which has been read.

Function to run when request received:
readFile(){
    if request is a valid file,
        read file contents line by line
    else
        throw an error or message saying the file doesn't exist
}

Returns whatever is in data, the variable that will contain whatever is
read in the file.
getData() {
    return data
}
