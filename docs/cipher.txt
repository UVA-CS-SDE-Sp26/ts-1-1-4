CIPHER MODULE DOCUMENTATION
Team Member D - Ciphering Feature

PURPOSE
Deciphers encrypted text using substitution cipher from key file.

CIPHER KEY FILE STRUCTURE
Location: ciphers/key.txt (default) or custom path
Format: Two lines of equal length
  Line 1: Original character set
  Line 2: Cipher substitutions (corresponding encrypted characters)

Example:
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
  bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890a

CIPHER LOGIC
- Substitution cipher: maps cipher characters to actual characters
- Deciphering reverses the mapping (cipher char → actual char)
- Characters not in key remain unchanged (spaces, punctuation)

KEY VALIDATION
- File must exist and be readable
- Must contain exactly 2 lines
- Both lines must have same length
- Each line must contain unique characters (no duplicates)
- Throws IllegalArgumentException if validation fails

METHODS
Cipher(String keyFilePath)
  - Loads and validates cipher key from file
  - Throws IOException if file cannot be read
  - Throws IllegalArgumentException if key format invalid

decipher(String cipheredText)
  - Replaces each cipher character with actual character
  - Leaves characters not in key unchanged
  - Returns deciphered text

ERROR HANDLING
- File not found: IOException
- Invalid key format: IllegalArgumentException
- Detailed error messages for diagnosis
